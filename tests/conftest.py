"""Shared fixtures for the tenuo-claude-code unit tests.

These tests exercise the PURE decision logic — routing, constraint construction,
approval encoding, subagent attenuation routing — with no Docker, no authorizer,
and no network. The point is a fast feedback loop and a CI gate that proves the
leash's *logic* (not just that `init` writes files). Anything that needs a live
authorizer lives in the `verify` self-test / the enforcement CI job instead.
